judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer
we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table
the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip
i have eaten at saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world
the wine list is interesting and has many good values
for the price , you can not eat this well in manhattan
i was very disappointed with this restaurant
food was okay , nothing great
chow fun was dry pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family
i/we will never go back to this place again
went on a 3 day oyster binge , with fish bringing up the closing , and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended , because it was so great !
you ca n't go wrong here
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street
everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible
ca n't wait wait for my next visit
i had my eyes on this place , promising myself i will one day 'give it a try '
and i hate to say this but i doubt i 'll ever go back
the food is very average the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree
anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , i would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari
the decor is night tho but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern
what 's the difference between the two
their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
the perfect spot
food - awesome
service - friendly and attentive
ambiance - relaxed and stylish
do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart
the food is decent
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm
this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area
i had a great experience
food is great
service is top notch
i have been going back again and again
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
the rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth
in the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , ny crowd
the food was well prepared and the service impecable
i 'm going back
the service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !
i 've had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times , when i have been in the neighborhood
6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled
i am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great
frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison
go hungry and enjoy
the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it
the service varys from day to day- sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not
the kitchen however , is almost always slow
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday
once you step into cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path parisian bistro
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair
the food was average to above-average the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
i have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews i got take out last week
it was horrible
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn
a big disappointment , all around
i think i 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow
the seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises
the combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious
was there friday night
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous
and i 've been to many nyc delis
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it
price no more than a jersey deli but way better
as a japanese native , i 've lived in the tristate area for over 8 years , but i was just so amazed at this place
this place is the most japanese it can ever get
the signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese
this place is worth an one-hour drive
i am so coming back here again , as much as i can
leon is an east village gem casual but hip , with well prepared basic french bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere
my wife and i always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story
sit outside in the warm weather inside for cozy winter
decent wine at reasonable prices
have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood
the service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions
you 'll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare
i 'm partial to the gnocchi
this place is incredibly tiny
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive
the food was bland oily
we went to ino for valentines
we have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service
we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes
this is a fun restaurant to go to
but the pizza is way to expensive
a large is 20 , and toppings are about 3 each
sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor
if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you
i do n't think i would go again
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of
the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !
service was prompt , friendly and great
slightly on the pricey side but worth it !
there was a small wait , but shorter than i expected
located at the end of a magnificent block
very cozy and warm inside
get the tuna of gari
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side
planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too
with the great variety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored
it 's all about the food ! !
first it took us a long time to find the place
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece
hurley 's is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came
try everything for that matter , it is all good
i have been going there since it opened and i ca n't get enough
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace
the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed
the steak tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table
it may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area
have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response
pizza - the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
veal parmigana - better than patsy 's !
much more reasonably priced too !
not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
i 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll
it 's delicious !
moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was very salty !
took my mom for mother 's day , and the maitre d ' was pretty rude
told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced
try their chef 's specials -- they are to die for
service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
when we stumbled on leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem but , we were certainly wrong
such a disappointment
rude service , medicore food there are tons of restaurants in ny stay away from this one
i had a grat time at jekyll and hyde !
i loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors
our server was very helpful and friendly
i am bringing my whole family back next time
the food was good too
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful
inside is a little cramped , but to be expected
this was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again
great service , great food
prices are in line
compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down
i live a block away and go to patsy 's frequently
the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's
also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling
so eat fast and order a lot
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant
fine dining restaurant quality
over 100 different choices to create your own
a must try !
on a recent sunday afternoon , a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt
this was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town
i grew up on these bagels
the staff is no nonsense
the food options rule
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else
i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a
being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action
for those of you who do n't know , uni is sea urchin in japanese , which happens to be my favorite )
he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you it was heaven !
the sake menu should not be overlooked !
all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll
we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their 35 menu
service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience )
wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top
i 've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square
to sum it up service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get generally it is just average ok
food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders
as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time
i have never been disappointed in the red eye
the first time i went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , i ordered the lobster cobb salad
i 've never ordered anything else from their menu there 's no need to
you can not go wrong at the red eye grill
if we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant
we 've lived in the area for more than 8 years
the restaurant is cute but not upscale
i would highly recommend it
it 's one of our favorite places to eat in ny
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat
my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini
the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner
please take my advice , go and try this place
its located in greenewich village
you will not be disapointed at all
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem
the bagel was huge
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy )
i loved it and would highly recommend
this was my frist time at cafe st. bart 's and i must say how delicous the food and the service was
when i called this morning , i did n't think i would be able to get in at 12 , but i was able to get in , along with four other guests
i have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo you can tell it was a fresh lobster
other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips
i highly recommend cafe st. bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service
all the staff is absolutely professional ! !
i sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes
( that is a must , but not every restaurant can do )
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant
it 's boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is 1
the price is reasonable although the service is poor
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends
keep up the good work
hats off to the chef
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food , but my friend who took me there is
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine
it was wonderful
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy
unbelievable
had a late night dinner on a saturday night
great vibe , lots of people
my husband and i both ordered the steak , medium
my husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry
will give it another chance before i write it off
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch
ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation
salads were fantastic
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me
we will be back
this is some really good , inexpensive sushi
it costs 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i 've had at this price range
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than 18 by just going off the menu
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment
they have it all -- great price , food , and service
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently
and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than 3-6 each )
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well
this place is always very crowded and popular
enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese very tasty
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious
we 'd go back again
i recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time
the staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it
we all felt it was worth it
sometimes i get good food and ok service
it is not consistent
really depends on your luck !
the place is a bistro which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere
and where does patis go wrong no where
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but cassuolet , steake fritte , tripe stew , etc simple stuff
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids
overall i would recommend it and go back again
coming from boston this place is like emma 's pizza in kendall square in cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
for dinner i had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan
mmmmm it was delicious
i ca n't wait to go back
we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant
the food is authentic italian - delicious !
pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta
ambience is delightful , service impeccable
i 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food
the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent
the filet mignon dish was superb !
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices
i absolutely love this place ! ! !
from the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse
i like the ambience , it 's very dark and original
i came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since
the sushi is amazing ! ! !
and amazingly cheap
very affordable and excellent ambient !
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai
we were very disappointed
we wo n't go to this place again for a good meal
however , i think this place is a good hang out spot
next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
the pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny -- i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it
highly recommended ! ! ! ! !
first of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review
either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced
slightly above average wines start at 70+ with only one selection listed at 30+
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora
fish was overdone
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again
one of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it
myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else
i 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious
their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for
i come from a family of pizzeria owners , and i 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino 's blows my families receipies away
it is simply amazing
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious
you will find yourself returning quite often
p.s please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there
lol
no gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs
looking around , i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen
beautiful experience
the view is breathtaking the service is top notch the ambiance is wonderfull
the staff offers impeccable service
i had filet mignon with garlic mash
it was divine melts in your mouth
my boyfriend had prime rib it was good
we did n't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough
it 's cuz it 's so good you need to taste it ! ! !
all in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks ! ! ! !
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food
it 's very spicy but not offensive
we will definitely go back
go to volare for 1st class service and terrific food
the wine list is excellent
the food is amazing especially if you get the chef 's tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like
please be aware that it 's cash or amex only !
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great
the menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees
the decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable
no plans to return anytime soon
this place is so much fun
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build
i think the stuff was better than disney
our food was great too !
and really large portions
we will go back every time we are in the city
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions
i highly recommend it
i am going to the mid town location next
the place is a lot of fun
my six year old loved it
the characters really make for an enjoyable experience
the food however , is what one might expect
it is very overpriced and not very tasty
however , i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once
we had a good time
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them
drinks way over priced
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
great pizza for lunch place
service was quick
the pizza was great
have the iced tea
it was wonderful
whenever you need a sushi fix , mizu will be there with quality fish and great service
great friendly service , fast seating , fast delivery , excellent sushi
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite
growing up in ny , i have eaten my share of bagels
ess-a-bagel ( either by sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in ny
the bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great
the lox is always fresh too
highly recommended to all !
i have to agree with the previous reviewer
i do n't get it either
not impressed with the food
i thought this place was totally overrated
everything we had was good or ok definitely nothing great
the ambience was nice , but service was n't so great
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu
the atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance
despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art
i must give it yon out of yon stars !
taxan delicious !
arigato gozimas yuka !
this restaurant was recommended by a local as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !
we were n't !
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food
we liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me
try green curry with vegetables
the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied
i was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time
i had the best ravioli ever
moderate prices
a little noise but i think that was because of our party !
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment
whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite
although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food quality and service overcompensate
a guaranteeed delight !
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years , emilio ( the godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices
if you go , try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en carozza is mmmmmmmm everything is just delicious
old school meets new world
i pray it stays open forever
ciao bella
i found the food , service and value exceptional everytime i have been there
the food was authentic
i felt as though i were eating in paris
the service was excellent - friendly and attentive
very good wine choices
i ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks
who has room for cheesesticks with the best pizza in nyc !
get the pepperoni - yum - and a family style salad
great staff
always great service !
i go twice a month !
fantastic !
the food is good , i ca n't lie
but the staff was so horrible to us
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out
this place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
amma is nothing special
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive
will not be back
do n't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections
decor is nice though service can be spotty
this place is always packed
i know because i live nearby
most importantly , food is excellent
try the sea bass
highly recommended
as a student in nyu i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here
just awsome
they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey
but overall i give it a 10
10
i have n't been to the other locations
haru on park s is simply disgusting
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale
quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish
the waitstaffs are nice though
wont come back again for sure !
i have been to roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing
once for dinner and once for brunch
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was
this was a great surprise
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room
i look forward to eating here again
we love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
the svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
just because it 's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait
it 's popular w/the late crowd
also , the sandwiches ( nearing 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side
overall , not worth the money
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience
i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it
they have authentic indian at amazin prices
this restaurant is vegetarian there are no meat dishes whatsoever
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
it 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff
the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates
food is excellent
fish is so very fresh
love yuka
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices
even though its good seafood , the prices are too high
the lobster sandwich is 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price
we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect
we were very pleasantly surprised
when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort
truly the mark of an attentive waiter
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods
why
they do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money
please do n't fool us
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke
i recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice
of course , it is crowded but who cares
authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york
have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent
cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at 10
the large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating
wine list is extensive without being over-priced
be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials
definitely a neighborhood favorite
i loved this place ! !
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded
the food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !
the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place
pizza here is consistently good
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal
you should pass on the calamari
decor is charming
service is average
what a great place
i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband
the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty
i was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but i guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently
the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald 's than this joint
never again !
i absolutely loved this place
my friends spoke so much about it for months , i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in
excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation
the wine list is also really nice
a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around
everything was wonderful food , drinks , staff , mileau
i would highly recommend this place !
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there
the food is great and reasonably priced
i have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name
if the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table
the staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent
from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service
nice family owned traditional restaurant
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend
my friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good not outstanding , but good
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there
overall , excellent restaurant !
the food was good
the place was nice and calm
but the service was a bit slow
the buffet had a nice selection
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes
i would go back
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries
i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
but , they were too big for the bun
consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them
also they were 15 each !
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday , and i was thoroughly impressed with the food
the pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i 'd never heard of before
conveniently located too , being right on bedford ave
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden
i will definetly be going back
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic
my husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one
we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right
we will be back
love the food
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food
and you ca n't beat the prices
highly recommended
i 've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all
the dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest i 've ever had )
also very inexpensive
a great choice at any cost and a great deal
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date
average to good thai food , but terrible delivery
a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called , cold and soggy
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money
went to cafe spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night
she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others
i went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table
service here was great , food was fantastic
guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared
will absolutely visit again
maybe tomorrow SMILE
you can not go wrong with this place
the food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional
good for dates or with friends
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded
by far , the best pizza in manhattan
the crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly
for all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to alphabet city , i say , good - stay out
less wait time for me !
we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly
the menu has so many fish items and oysters
we all ordered different entrees so we could share
the fish was really , really fresh
i lived in maine for ten years and grew up on fish
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
i highly recommend the sophia pizza
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back
as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry
our friends have not arrived yet
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !
i 'm sure i 'll return for a final judgement tho
the blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great
mizu is the japenese find in grammercy
while their kitchen food is delicious , their sushi is out of this world
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else
not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming
warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu !
the entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
definitely worth the trip to battery park city !
one of my favorite places in manhattan
authentic taiwanese food that 's cheap what more could you ask for
( besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city )
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan
kind , attentive wait staff
i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto - yum ! )
my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos
delicious crab cakes too
even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax
great neighborhood joint
this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice
their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , yuck
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone
the counter service is bad
they charge different prices all the time
they 're rude at times , and not very friendly
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary
the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i 'd drink popcorn topping before i 'd eat another one of these
the sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced
calling the place hampton chutney co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too
seriously , this place kicks ass
the atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant
best italian food i ever had ( and being italian , that means alot )
it is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , do not pass it up
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty
it is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise
the food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious
this is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset
nice value
unique apppetizers
try sushimi cucumber roll
good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty
the big complaint no toasting available
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted
murray wo n't do it
wo n't or ca n't is not in the service directory
but who says murray 's is anything about service
so close , but not good enough
do n't be fooled by crowds of people
the service is awful
this place is not worth the prices
also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it
love pizza 33
i will be out with friends and all of a sudden i am hungry and i only crave one thing their pizza
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular
it hits the spot every time
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising
even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in new york pizza restaurants )
i 've been many time and have never been disappointed
compared to ess-a , tal offers a less doughy bagel !
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee ! !
a little crowded but they move that line really fast !
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning !
bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
be sure not to get anything other than bagels !
the turkey burgers are scary !
the worst excuse for japanese food i 've ever encountered
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water
the sushi was awful !
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard
furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting
the fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine
good , fast service
i would highly recommend
food is great and inexpensive
the location is perfect
give it a try and enjoy
i thought going to jimmys would give me a real domincan exprience
jimmy is dominican !
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here
would never go back there
too bad latin quarters closed
awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice
always busy but fast moving
great atmoshere and worth every bit
open late ( well as late as i ever got there and i 'm a night person )
winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you
the food is reliable and the price is moderate
what more can you ask for
for authentic thai food , look no further than toons
ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before , and toons is by far the best thai food ive had ( except for my mom 's of course )
try the pad thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu they 're all delicious
the service was attentive , yet discreet
the flavors robust and subtle
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal
i 'm saving up for my next visit
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date
the place was quiet and delightful
service was good and food is wonderful
i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good )
it is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat
as a retired hipster , i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city
the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b * way )
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts
you can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for 8.50 ( i recommend the vanilla shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music
the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests
you ca n't go wrong with this place
i will go back to suan soon !
in summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of suan ) ! ! !
i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city
i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location
during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better
i wish they would change back to what it was before
the food now is inconsistent
this is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret
the setting is casual and romantic
prices are very good
the food is excellent !
if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful !
do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say
they were such a rip-off ( 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative
a few tips skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard
( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner
i was pleasantly suprised
the food was exceptional
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like balthazar etc
i choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily
i would just ask for no oil next time
have eaten at ginger house several times , and it 's always good
the fried dumplings are great !
finally a reliable chinese restaurant !
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything
terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven
spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey
service is fast and friendly
only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel
but that is highly forgivable
been there , done that , and new york , it 's not that big a deal
the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying
rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special
but after last night , spice grill is the only place i 'm eating indian cuisine
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time
great food , great prices , great service
if you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food
i really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food
also it 's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place , the service it 's just perfect they 're so frendly that we never want to live the place !
i love ess-a-bagel , but i live on the west side , so i often go to murray 's for convenience
their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a 'special ' bagel experience
better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place
great bagels made the old-fashioned way
the appetizing is excellent - just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound )
the food was absolutely amazing ! !
the lamb was tender so full of flavor , the dessert was divine ! !
the waiter was attentive
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening
downtown dinner 2002 - prixe fix appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion..try the potato stuff kanish best one
dessert is a joke dont bother
volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly
the restaurant has a family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine
the anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains
still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house
fantastic place
a pleasant surprise
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else
lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat
yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't
great food , great decor , great service
i recommend it !
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
( always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer ! ! !
guaranteed to be a tasty experience ! )
excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while
i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over 5 years now and i have never been disappointed !
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant
a cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer
and even with it 's pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
loved it !
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens , this is among the best
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful
it is expensive but well worth the money
if you venture off the island of manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great italian restaurant , drive to corona
the only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service
the only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave
wonderful at holiday time
service was very prompt but slightly rushed
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle
a real dissapointment
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies
priced at upper intermediate range
everything i had was good , and i 'm a eater
it was pretty inexpensive too
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge )
it 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city
it 's somewhere you can eat and be happy
when i 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , i head for cafe st. bart 's
when you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside
the food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly
i ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio
i recently tried suan and i thought that it was great
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood
they all know you
good food
good drink
how do you rate home
i have never had cheescake like this
the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices
have been several times and it never dissapoints
we were less than impressed
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better
we ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table
skip dessert
a classic !
do n't miss bloom 's on your next trip to manhatten
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york
thanks bloom 's for a lovely trip
as a fan of thai , i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as i love la pizza fresca )
pizza was a little soggy
service , however , was excellent and i liked the setting/atmosphere a lot
food was just average if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw
this place is a great bargain
people are always friendly
do n't waste money on decor
just straight up cheap , good food
faan is sooo good
the best pad thai i 've ever had
the design and atmosphere is just as good
bottles of wine are cheap and good
what more could you want
i 'm not picky - but it was actually gross
the mussles were the fishiest things i 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w/ chicken had bones in it it was disgusting
nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good
would n't recomend it for dinner !
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes
the food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza
best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast
if only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !
go here for the drinks !
esp during happy hour !
enough said !
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm
ask for usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan
i really recommend the very simple unda ( egg ) rolls
delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti
amazing !
toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space
the food 's as good as ever
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food , this is one of the best spots
went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money
ca n't wait to go back
best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
beef noodle soup is good as well
the service is good and the resturant is clean
best taiwanese food in ny !
i have been to rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better
for those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all i can say is that they just do n't get it
good luck getting a table
my roommate and i love this place
we recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since i had my yorkie with me
indoor was very cozy and cute
while it 's not nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full
staff is very accomodating
excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor
i got the 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great
but 1 for each small piece
not worth it
i wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill
the decor is very simple but comfortable
the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth
great indian food and the service is incredible
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them
everyone was more then happy with his choices
great food and the prices are very reasonable
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong , it actually means great prosperity
the food here does a great service to the name ( cantonese that is )
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread
simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices
service is not what you are coming here for
just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service i need
big wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach
this place we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on point
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices
even the wine by the glass was good
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are
consistently good japanese tapas
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon , which is just down the street on st. marks and 1st ave
always good drinks and service is pretty good
atmosphere is nice and relaxed too
yakitori ( bbq meats ) is tasty too
it 's also attached to angel 's share , which is a cool , more romantic bar
if you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit
was n't going to share but i feel obligated while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing
no thanks ! ! !
this place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps queens ' biggest secret !
one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
we left , never to return
with so many good restaurants on the uws , i do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave
great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in
you fellas above says its the best taiwanese restaurant in town
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town
the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre
they 're are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing , queens
baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent
he offers subpar service and has no personality
skip this location and go to the one in soho
there is no excuse for such lousy service !
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing
you can do it here
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there
the restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated
the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also
me and my girls will definitely go back
food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat
i 've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times , but more often i order delivery
the food is great
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights
i heartily recommend
there is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have major attitude
never have i had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c i live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips
love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate , location wise
the pizza was pretty good and huge
the price very reasonable
we were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion a bucket of food literally
we got most of it back at home with us
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine
the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed lol
no , really
la rosa waltzes in , and i think they are doing it the best
interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor
i have been twice to this restaurant
i love it
i plan on stopping by next week as well
i found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up
i recieved prompt service with a smile
definately check it out ! ! !
this place blew me away by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side
the wine list is extensive and impressive
love the atmosphere - felt like i was in paris
i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna
over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor
i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
i love this place !
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon , sea bass and crispy duck
we got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about
