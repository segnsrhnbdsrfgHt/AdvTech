ripping mp3s and slow load make the treo not a great music player.
the first and foremost thing i look for in a phone is the sound quality.
hold times - at&t so far has had some pretty low hold times , also they don't don't charge you for calling them for support like several others do.
the magnet is stronger as well.
so after getting my htc thunderbolt from verizon, i thought i'll give this booster another try and see if it'll enhance my reception.
picture quality is also improved.
reception is great, although i'm still not thrilled with t-mobile's coverage here in the northeast.
the stand works great if you buy the other stand and use them together.
this is a mid-priced phone, with solid features all-around, including bluetooth, good reception, nice compact size, and good battery life.
the magnets that connect the earpieces to the headset is really good.
if you're debating between this phone and the v300- the v300 is an upgrade from this phone in every way except for the camera.
the concept is wonderful, and it works well for the most part.
i haven't found a single pair of bluetooth headphones yet that sound decent to talk on.
dash area is flat ... so, no experience how it would hold on a slanted surface.
* plenty of volume.
features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and its hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages.
works great!
then i would need to replace the fuse holder.
love the wrist band.
they fit perfectly around my neck and are so lightweight i forget they're on all the time.
ear gels (important): this is probably going to be the biggest factor as to whether you are satisfied with these or not.
i've been a t-mobile customer for a while now and i stay with them because: 1) they are now no.
no delays like with verizon (up to 30 seconds!)
phone displays no issues when running oem battery.
do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device!
ver good range, good sound but no alert to end of call.
even the pacific and atlantic ocean!
yet another bogus tax.
i have been using this bracket to hold my 60cx to my handlebars and i have been extremely happy with the purchase.
16mb of memory is more than sufficient for most, i never filled the treo to the 32mb capacity except i used the memory card for books.
great replacement battery, once fully charge the phone worked for two full days with regular calls.
sounds amazing when listening to music.
these ear bud broke after only 2 month of use.
sound is not high at full volume which is my only con.
volume is on the weak side, absolutely no idea of remaining battery life, until only about 10 minutes left.
they charge it for land lines and wireless connections.
looks good but have not installed it yet.
i'm not a big fan of this os, or its abilities.
very refined clear mid and high with decent, tight bass which is not very common at this price range.
she is now watching for a good deal on motorola buds for herself.
we needed a better signal and thought at $2.99  for a 10 pack would be worth a shot.
i am very disappointed in this battery.
but i have to say its styling is more attractive than most of the plain-vanilla silver phones from asian manufacturers.
i realized after using a smaller charger, that something with more charge capacity was going to be a huge benefit.
ironically, i got the sonyericcson as a trade for a free ms smartphone that always crashed, locked and never worked right.
not satisfied with the quality of the product i purchased.
pro's nice screen good call quality good camera (compared to pthers in the market) nice look and finish good features comes with great useable ringtones con's speaker is low quality (i tried other v600's and experienced the same) sometimes there is a lag when the buttons are pressed it does
you'll be fine with a motorola phone as long as it works.
the buds fit in my ear.
her phone fit nice and snug and there was a positive click when it reached the plug on the bottom of the case.
as far as sound quality goes, im really impressed.
i like that these come in the same color as my phone.
i got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer.
and plusses of the lg over the motorola were not worth the hassle of trying to figure out of this could be remedied.
it is tiny and hard use.
i am sure most people will be happy with the sound quality of the e715.
the range of the headset is quite good, but i get more static in my apartment.
these pads are too light wieght for what i bought them for.
strong tie cord.
it fits horribly.
the motorola buds feel like you have a dog collar around your neck.
so i can listen to music all day long without recharging these earbuds, and i think that's fabulous.
the posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose.
the sound quality is good for conversations and they fit well in your ear.
okay - not easy to wear, for me, and after the first use, did not ever recharge again.
my biggest gripe lies with the keyboard, which is too small and too minimalistic.
the headset sounds excellent.
another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy.
(copy them to the optional transflash card from your computer, then to the phone) seems to have great signal strength, at least here in la.
there are 3 eq modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be.
they cost about twice what this mount costs but they are definitley worth the price.
a negative seemed to be that the watch band is long - really long.
lasts a long time and ships quickly
loud beeps when you adjust the volume, too.
these have a great design allowing me to lean back and relax without bumping them out of place.
this works perfectly for my application.
although i did like the controls and position of the buttons on the tone+ better, i am very happy with my motorola buds.
the quality is decent.
the only thing i can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.
all volume levels can be set from whisper quiet to loud loud!
i haven't taken so many pictures until i bought this phone.. the round keyboard takes time to get used to but once i have used it a few days..
reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.
it seems that motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty.
battery life is all i expected.
a new model, the treo 610, is rumored to come out soon, with a better screen and improved battery life -- but probably still the same slow internet speed, which is more a problem with the 2.5g network than the treo hardware per se.
i really thought i had found the perfect bluetooth headphones!!!
right out of the box it was easy to pair with my motorola v505 phone.
purchased two of these items specifically for mounting my garmin 60csx on my bike handlebars.
below you'll find my original review, before this morning's problem: original review: i love these buds!!!!!
the band is very, very long and for some folks with small wrists even the last hole to snap the slack in is not enough.
this headset is very uncomfortable, and does not get as good a battery life as the motorola's or jabra's.
and since the buckle is so high up, don't expect to put a classy watch face on the top and have it be mistaken for anything else with the silver buckles present.
unfortunately tylt didn't see fit to cover the very shiny silver buckle and end bolt the same black color.
the camera is so low quality that it might as well not be on the phone.
one last thing about audio quality if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero.
fits anywhere,stays in place.
extra bass is necessary because the wind noise washes the bass notes away.
the motorola buds are longer and too large for cosmos case.
sanyo added a few extra nice features for this phone like an alarm (yippie!!!)
i realize that motorola buds may not have all the features that the tone+ has, but they pair and play perfectly with my phone.
my second complaint: the on/off.
audio books may have issues.
also this product is well packaged compared to other maps.
the motorola software also allows you to sync to your microsoft outlook contacts and calendar, and it was truly easy to use!
this data cable is not for the palm pre.
arrived on time as described.
i wish i had read others reviews because as the others pointed out it does not fit the palm tx.
sort of wish i bought the deeper one, but this is cool for light applications.
great about upgrades.
i understand the material they are made of keep them light, but they feel sooo incredibly cheap.
great sound... just wish i could charge them while in use.
i can barely tell which eq mode is bass boost, but cant tell the difference between the other two.
in terms of sound, i think the sony mw600 with stock earbuds have better sound.
otherwise it is comfortable and the sound quality is pretty decent on speaker and microphone.
battery last long.
my whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry.
love it and great price too!
the kicker is when you figure out that your gps hardly works at all, and you have already signed up for a year's telenav service, telenav won't refund you a single dime.
movie times and all that other stuff as well, and "snocountry" tells you the amount of snow at any hill in america.
also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.
i had been very happy with my motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off.
traded mine for a samsung i500 and am much happier except for the lack of after-market add-ons or lack of stock.
wires are two tone.
very poor audio performance.
excellent fit and feel.
there is a flash and a zoom feature which is added bonus.
this thing has so many charge terminals on it!
too hard to quickly turn on or off rapidly because it's not a switch like the lgs but a press and hold button.
the quality seems up to motorola's standards but the volume isn't loud enough when listening to music or when having a conversation.
but it also takes long time to charge it.
anyway, unless you have lots of money to throw away and don't feel like giving it charity, i recommend you wait for the next generation of treo.
it fits great.
i live about 100 miles from where this was shipped, just love it...thought it would be here faster than it was....but...ships in a tube...so came damage free...cool map and pretty funny letter that they send with it...made me laugh...highly recommended .......kinda nice u know ...do yourself a favor and check
i love the concept of this headset.
can use all accessories (ac power, usb cable, sd card, stylus) without having to take the e2 out of the case.
fit well.
gnarly box.
installation was simple and all parts were included.
the screen is amazingly bright, much better than my sony nx70.
the speaker volume is also really loud.
works great but it's so big!
it gives my cell phone a little more boost and works very good.
pretty much i've been quite pleased with the service i've gotten so far, but i still think the plans are over priced.
i am using this connector as charger for my portable stereo.
the sound quality is okay, but for the price they are asking it could be better.
it is the perfect size (and its visually pleasing), and it has the countries, states, and cities all laid out and printed.
negative features: bad battery life when usign bluetooth & ir excessivly, strange keypad layout [you get used to it], bluetooth learning curve, slow 'boot-up' [about 30 seconds].
all in all another great sanyo product!
it is small and unobtrusive the battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking.
can power many other things, too...can't find one labeled "surge protector" on amazon, but bb sells them.
i have previously owned a samsung s105, which was a nice phone as well so it was easy for me to learn this phone since many menu functions were similar.
there is a voice notification of eq mode changed!
i have three issues with the motorola buds -- 1) sound quality, 2) fit and length of cable, and 3) some weird bluetooth connection issues.
as a communications engineer i believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.
works very nice.
it served its purpose and looked good doing it.
overall, sound is good.
i say the bass is better that the hbs-730.
i use the wrist strap that came with the gps.
note that it does include two rubber strips of different thickness for different diameter handle bars.
a hassle sometimes, but at least the phone is secure.
an extra bonus with these earbuds: i can walk clear to the back of our building from my desk (about 75 feet) and still get signal, albeit spotty.
it is weatherproof and the plugs stay locked in place
as others have mentioned, the band is a little long, but not so much that it's a problem.
or sprint (10 secs).
they sound great, have pretty good battery life.
they sound fine.
lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life.
the moto buds are extremely lightweight and easy to pair with nearly every device that supports bluetooth 4.0.
this friction mount is relatively small but stays well on all dashboards i've used it on.
these are half the price of your sony sbh or your lg tones, and the battery life is better as a trade off for sound quality and style.
good item, just sticky enough to hold items without them moving around on the dash of my car.
this headset is nice and snug and works great.
finally, the earbuds are very small.
adhesive not very strong on a big cell phone.
make sure it has a built-in surge protector.
all in all, it's a great concept and works well aside from the two gripes listed above.
i also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty.
the phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors.
as long as you won't be driving or anywhere loud, these will probably work pretty well for you and the price is good.
my only concern now is how long these motorola earbuds will last.
the comfort is the best i never use.
i also like the different profiles, which enable you to quickly switch profiles for meetings (i.e.
when i compared to other similar price range bt headphones, such as soundpeats qy7 or mpow, the volume isn't quite loud enough.
my wife liked my nokia 3650 so much that she switched chips with me and is carrying it.
that's really bad, that these earbuds went from five stars two days ago to one star today.
the layout of the controls is spot-on; they're easy to use and locate.
to be frank, i had high expectations for the treo 600, after reading so much about it in the time leading up to its release.
although it now looks a little out of style.
good for activities where i want to avoid getting sweat on my leather band.
as far as looks and comfort, having these earbuds around my neck doesn't bother me at all.
the charge lasts around 8 hours.
pair's easily.
also when i check the built quality, it is solidly built and designed.
the camera is slow - don't expect to catch anything in motion - but adequate.
(nextel does have models specifically for those types of conditions...) the screen tends to be too dim to read in bright, direct sunlight, and the light "sensor" seems to add to the problem.
worked great in my 1991 gmc sonoma.
good audible range.
metra 72-4568 does not fit.
glad i bought map.
all fits well.
i have looked at other phones from other carriers and none compare to the i730.
it holds my cell phone and mp3 player just fine and gets stuff off my desk.
i do think that the microphone is a bit sensitive to movement on your shirt or collar which can create a loud sound for your caller on the other end (so i try to remain still while on a call) but the stereo sound is good and the bluetooth connection
fits in perfectly
the fact that i can not play mp3s due to the limited memory of the samsung vs. the treo is not an issue as i have an ipod.
the attached dust cap is a nice touch.
there are some design flaws.
in my opinion the buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones.
works as advertised this is the best sticky pad i have had.
they stay in his ears, the music sounds great, he hardly hears the background noise, calls sound good on both ends, and there is no cord to fight with.
looks very elegant - surprisingly so.
i didn't expect ansel adams quality, but it's not what i get from my old 1 mp camera, either.
with some other phones such as the sony ericcson t610 you can simply transfer files through window's default program when you match your phone's infra red port with your laptop's.
and those 3rd party software is very expensive.
huge capacity, and far more flexibility than my "standard" chargers.
also, it's solidly built and feels sturdy.
now the additional features that the v205 didn't have that this little gadget has is: 1) caller id pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.
it lasted all day and i still had plenty of juice when i was ready to settle in the hotel room.
it is just a couple of flimsy rubber bands that could be broken in a week or two.
the other program which i like is called psm play which allows you to edit midi files and convert them into mmf.
this behind-the-neck design is genius.
not as great as the zero lemon charge which holds for up to 3月4日 days on continuous use but that one is very bulky so not very satisfactory in that regard - this charger is smaller/sleek and holds a charge certainly longer than the standard battery but my first day
the sound is tinny and doesn't seem loud enough even with the headset and phone both on max volume.
at first, this battery kept me going all day.
only had it a couple days seems great loved the fast delivery
really cute case, but extrremely hard to take off.
the v220 has very clear sound quality, great screen and excellent battery life.
this device did not help at all.
my lg hbs-730 that i use for bike rides with no problem.
but, if you can get passed that, it does work pretty well.
these headphone were given to me as a gift.
it shows not only the us, but all the countries!
the earbuds are flat on the outside and therefore not bulky in the ear.
i also like t-mobile.
for me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use.
very hard to hear in high winds volume is quite low.
it was working fine until a couple of days ago i hit a bump on my road bike and (as some else mentioned) the little circle part cracked.
after the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable "due to customer abuse."
the volume adjustment was actually on the right side and the call/play and track buttons are on the left side.
the bluebuds sound as good as bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even mkbhd says they are amazing).
but every rose has its thorns, and alas the moto buds are not without their flaws.
this charger did not work well on my phone at all.
they came with three different sized buds, but the ones they came with worked fine.
my only complaint is that the case part of the item doesn't provide much protection to the screen.
they are far superior in build quality and strength.
it's like a tuxedo for your i730.
excellent article i am satisfied with the quality mu and the timely delivery excellent article i am satisfied with the quality mu and the timely delivery
i use sanyo eneloops and also some older duracell rechargeable.
i'd have thought there would not have been any drop in power for a while.
i am using the biggest rubber buds that came with the device, and they still slide out.
example- this phone does not have an easy to use datebook to set off alarms to remind you of appointments- it does not have a speakerphone which worked well on the v300 and was very handy at times- and just simply, it is like a commodore 64 computer in a
only slight problem with cable, have to 'wiggle' the cable to get charging to start.
pros: battery life: is very good.
easy to attach the gps and easy to memove it.
it's like the cables are not long enough to facilitate such movement comfortably.
long piano hinge for strength.
love the sound quality of music.
fyi to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely.
it has 3 slots for credit cards, 2 slots for memory cards, and a holder for your stylus.
other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone.
mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on the conference calls.
sound quality and range are amazing.
easy to use sound is pretty good.
light weigth and good sound plus 10 hours of playing music time
i purchased the very same item days later and now there's an "estimated regulatory cost recovery fee".
the sanyo 8200 is a solid phone that will be far superior to many alternatives.
sound: received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you.
we just use text messages most of the time.
and this pad's stickiness is just right, where as other sticky pads you will have to use force peel your cellphone off the stick mat and the cellphone paint and then you need to re-apply the phone's screen protector touch up the cellphone's lost paint.
i have no problems listening on the device and volume is adequate.
i have tried a lot of headsets and this is the most clear (and loud)!!!
the battery life is the worst of any phone i've ever owned.
despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it.
the protrusions on the top and bottom do not stack.
the mount is easy to affix, one screw opens the clamshell design.
i lost my 2-year-old lg tone hbs-700 headset and someone else is doubtless enjoying it.
works when it works, but frequently stops working.
buds are small enough and fit well into my hear holes that i can get my motorcycle helmet on and off with these in place without disturbing them!
let the buyer beware - it may have been that i just got a bad pair, but i read at least one other review that mentioned this very same problem with the rubber stripping underneath the "collar", so i know i was not the only one.
the nextel tech that i spoke to (in cancelling "total connect") said telenav told them that they should not gaurantee telenav to ever function.
well i have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's.
the first is these danged ear bud cables.
good quality
samsung has voicedial and speed dials that exceed that of the treo and i like that better.
my new battery life is considerably better.
this a high quality band and it feels and looks way better than the leather band that came with my moto 360 2nd.
the headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects.
it has good reception, sync's well,comfortable, very long charge(holds longer than my phone, and has easy to press buttons.
the magnets that are used to attract the earbuds and keep them secure are very strong, so strong that the glue that sticks the metal tips to the plastic came undone.
installed with no issues.
honestly they sound like really premium ear buds with excellent sound.
i no longer have to worry about running out of battery for those days when i have to use the phone more than usual.
the negatives i'll split into ergonomics, sound and rf performance.
on actual use, i have been quite disappointed.
1 in customer service, 2) great rate plans, 3) it works great where i need it the most!
i should point out that the buds will still sound great with non-apt-x devices like apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other bluetooth headsets that don't support it.
here are the good features about this phone: 1)it has no external antenna to brake off 2)the camera takes better pictures than the v300 3)it is very small but still comfortable to use here are the bad things about this phone: 1)the sound quality of a call on the receiver
size-wise it is not too much bigger than the original phone (considering that the battery is double) and i think it actually makes it easier to hold the phone.
the next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once.
well it is a rubberized hard case like all the others she has gotten.
other bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad.
this is a standard computer-to-microusb cable and it will work with a pre for data connections and so on.
great sound and pairing is seamless.
very happy with this box.
if i so much as put my phone in a pocket the bt signal starts to break up which is annoying when you're running.
the first set was durable, sweat resistant, has excellent controls for: google now, skipping tracks, volume control.
in chicago, the gps never works (and yes i went by the window dozens of times).
battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds.
hopefully they start making bigger ones so i can make a big travel map for the family to put in the basement!
the only downside is that the names of the cities are pretty small--and depending what types of pins you use--the pin may cover up the city.
i would like to say that this is not cheap junk, but it did nothing at all for my cell reception.
i hope they take this into consideration for what is an otherwise great watch band that i think justifies a more premium price.
the video is pretty useless as well.
with regards to pairing, controls, and functionality, these are really easy to learn and will do everything that meets my needs.
i cranked this bad boy up and you can hear the bass seemed liked it wanted to come out but seemed restricted.
the phone end of the charging cable is the weak point of the palm pre and is not the standard usb end.
if you want to buy camera phone this is not for you.
it's comfortable enough to wear for long periods, and it's very unobtrusive.
they stay on place well though, sounds is pretty decent.
easy access to the connectors on the back
its easy to wipe off and the surface is smooth rather than the others that i have used that have grooves and difficult to clean.
and a good price too, not one bad thing to say about this.
- microphone is excellent, clear, loud, and crisp.
heavy duty, good connections
but seriously though, this is by far the best replacement battery i've ever seen/experienced with it.
nav of settings, utilities, etc.
to add more woes to this limitation, you cannot num-lock the numeric keys, so you always have to hold down the number shift key to type in numbers.
though the keypad is inconveniently small, it is still usable.
so now i must re-glue the metal tips to the "collar" so that the earbuds stay connected like they should.
this ansmann is superior in all ways to the lacrosse, other than portability of course.
if you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, nextel is the best.
also people can hear you very clearly because the microphone is very sensitive.
so i got the t68i and i am finally enjoying true cordless freedom.
i used a hole saw to cut out an opening in the lower console and installed the cigarette lighter socket.
it's works, but the thread strips very easily.
the speaker phone on the nokia is great for this purpose.
this phone does have a 40 chord midi capability which means you can download some good songs.
the buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate.
when using the lg hbs-700's they pretty much sounded the same between apps, or better in some instances, even if i disable all eq settings; not with the motorola buds.
i was impressed how it could take old batteries that wouldn't recharge in other chargers, and it completely restores them to working order!
i just got this phone and it's really slick but there is one very significant design flaw in the treo 600 that will cost you a ton of money -- beware.
so in exchange for agreeing to deregulation, they invented the beautifully-named regulatory cost recovery fee.
typical amazon good pricing and fast delivery.
this is a great phone in terms of reception.
is a great map very detailed and easy to read some of the countries listed have there names written in the language they speak.
luckily the v600 is still under warranty so a return is in it's future, and another phone will come to live with me.
the latches are a little tighter than the pelican case, especially to open, which is a good thing.
it is very beautiful and a great protection for the phone.
well-crafted and precise in all aspects of fitting and performance!
i have to say that the motorola buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt.
the only gripe here is that the call/answer button is the same button that activates the music player and changes tone.
the biggest treat for me is the color screen, the sleek-ness of the phone and it's overall aesthetic beauty.
both are about the same price, so be cool and be one of the few who have a samsung 1500 vs. the treo.
i get the best of both worlds, low phone fees, and great reception with the cellular innovation antenna.
if you have signal issues you need to spend real money, $$$, for a reputable booster like wilson or zboost or uniden (all available at amazon).
"there are not enough satelllites at this time".
the memo recorder could have used much more memory.
these earbuds have a unique design that somehow manages to fit in both of my ears, and they stay put, for the most part.
ear buds fit in ear no better, or worse than sny other product.
great sound quality, and buds fit great.
i had the samsung v205 and then i decided to try the e715 out.
the phone camera is not top-end but decent for daytime use.
pros: - consistently excellent battery life.
- sound could be fuller but probably decent for this price point.
works good and easy to put in
the sound is really good considering these aren't super pricey earbuds.
they break -super- easily but they work otherwise
a good inexpensive cable that works like the original.
display is very good for its size.
anyways, back to audio quality: one important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material.
they were really cheap and seem to be made well enough for my use.
all my friends are on the same wireless plan from nextel as i am, so i know its not service, it is definitely the phones.
the answer/end/voicedial button on the boom is nicely sized and well located.
it's very comfortable to wear.
volume is good.
they are a good headphone though.
these are workman headphones.
more than anything, i recommend buying the body glove cover/clip ... search for "body glove scuba, i730".
mine lasted a few months.
instead, it killed data reception.
i returned other adaptors and bought this adaptor again.
good in all weather conditions!
the plastic seems to be more resistant to scratching and cracking, the bottom and top of the case actually 'seal' together, and the top and bottom are both padded to protect the contents from shock, whereas the pelican case only has rubber padding on the bottom half.
plenty of space for exta things
signal is strong and good for more than 3 feet (unlike some others i have had).
add to the sound quality the comfort and superb ergonomics at work here -- and i have a new favorite pair of ear buds!
this is cheaply made and way to bulky.
all in all, this seems to be a rugged storage and organizational tool.
good range of connection.
they also have a small rubber band around the wires that the buds are connected to, which works well to adjust the length you need.
cons: * lifeless unrealistic sound.
two things to be aware of: 1) this is not a waterproof/sweatproof device.
also provided case is easy to hold and seems to provide good protection.
but this headset is so uncomfortable, that if i wear it for more than a few mins i have to take it off, beacuse it hurts so much.
it works best if you don't touch the antenna with your fingers, hold it by the sides or edge; smooth it with a smooth flat card.
the volume level is fantatic and the sound is very clear.
i like the quality of the sticky pad and the large size makes it a place to place multiple items.
i don't really use the camera feature, but the few times that i fooled around with it found that it took decent pictures.
one of the best and longest lasting headsets i've used.
we do mainly riding on the street but have done 50+ miles with the gps and have had zero issues.
from time to time, i lose connection with my phone.
this is what it feels like when you wear the motorola buds.
phone has a handy notepad and will take vocal notes, also.
it has a great front pocket that holds all of her sheet music and extra reeds.
works really well as a battery life extender.
crap i was excited about this band.
keypad is no biggie, you quickly get used to it -- and the layout is great as a thumboard for typing messages and such.
i needed a few small cases to store various items - radios, batteries, and such.
what really excites me about the phone is the inclusion of bluetooth and its quad-band capability.
this battery will last all day and into the next day.
the only strike against this product is that the manuel is written in german, but if you simply follow the color code on the front of the charger it will be enough.
i highly recommend this to every professional photographer.
there tips are little difficult to use but you can switch it out for the typical ones on most earbuds.
it also sticks to the center console very well.
great price and delivered quickly.
build quality is much better than the cheapy no-names.
the wires looked good.
look at the moto version with its own black metal band.
the top part of the case was a perfect fit as well and it snaps shut with a very firm grip on the phone, but it does seem like it will be a bit of a struggle to remove it.
it works good with a couple of drawbacks.
5) voice memo.. nuf said otherwise, it has the usual features.
i haven't fully tested battery life, but motorola claims you get up to eleven hours of playtime on a 90-minute charge.
sound quality is not perfect but good enough.
i've learned to forgive the moto buds for this over time because whenever i need them, they work perfectly.
pros: mp3 ringtones usb port external display good battery life cons: ringer not loud enough finish easily scratched camera quality poor reception poor screen contrast poor phone sometimes disconnects and screen goes blank.
he has made comments that he likes the motorola brand, that the brand has never caused him any issues, which is why i specifically bought motorola.
they are simple to use and do the job.
very useful 600 entry contact list, which can store all of a contact's info (home#, work#, cell#, fax#, email, etc.)
the clamp also has a positive clamping motion as it is hinged which makes it a bit more secure and easy to mount.
in fact, lexar sells the trio which handles sony memory sticks, sd, and mmc quite nicely and compactly.
my road bike of course has the thin tires pumped up to 125psi and does not handle the bumps well.
battery fits tight, this is good.
they are comfortable to wear, the cords haven't caught on anything yet (like ipod buds will) and once i got the right size ends they sealed out the outside sound to a large degree and gave greater volume.
on top of that, the volume is not high enough to hear the phone from the bottom of my purse.
i love this headset!
range is roughly 15-20 feet line-of-sight.
not worth the extra bulk.
also, once you experience the nextel service, it will definitely be your last and only phone carrier.
the battery lasts all day, and then some.
great otterbox dry box, i got the clear version as recommended by other reviews and like it.
i suspect they cut corners on the antenna.
i have different music apps on my phone, and the music sounds differently on all of them when using the motorola buds.
very good quality and easy to wear...you forget you are even wearing them!
cool features: bluetooth, mmc card [16mb included- but upgradable], large screen, plays any midi you can drop into it, ir connectivity.
it takes some time to understand the little quirks.
the controls are pretty easy to use once you get to know which button does what.
a little too much treble for me but i'll live with it.
..and i'm from europe, where the phones and networks are much better than in the states.
easy to pair.
the buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck.
good...the cell coverage has gotten better as far as talk, but the data service still is not working correctly and my mms does not work right either.
