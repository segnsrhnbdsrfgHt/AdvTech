i have had to replace our office treos --- in one case three times and twice in another, as the speaker (ear piece) fails.
i didn't realize that maps were insanely expensive!
the screen protector that came with this phone battery and case fit perfect and was really easy to put on without any issues and doesnt cover anything like the speaker or mic.
i don't really notice any difference in the reception.
there are some design flaws.
the instructions are well-documented and it doesn't take rocket-science to navigate through the i730 software.
they seem to take the most charge of any extended battery in my external charger and lasts longer.
to be frank, i had high expectations for the treo 600, after reading so much about it in the time leading up to its release.
product was kind of difficult to understand how to use, but it gets the job done, and i guess that's the most important part.
i use it with a garmin streetpilot 7200, which is a fairly large, even somewhat clunky gps with a large 7-inch screen.
it has 3 slots for credit cards, 2 slots for memory cards, and a holder for your stylus.
he's been looking for a good, sturdy pack for a while.
walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.
the back piece also sits very sturdy.
but this headset is so uncomfortable, that if i wear it for more than a few mins i have to take it off, beacuse it hurts so much.
it does recognize l and r speakers so it does feel like surround sound and you can't hear anything else around you: truly noise canceling.
all in all, this is a great entry-level bluetooth headset, priced right for the "value-conscious" consumer.
it's proven to be a bulletproof email device.
otherwise, it must be stated that i do like nextel service and the web browser is the best of it's kind.
really good product for price.
hold times - at&t so far has had some pretty low hold times , also they don't don't charge you for calling them for support like several others do.
the moto buds are extremely lightweight and easy to pair with nearly every device that supports bluetooth 4.0.
believe it or not, i don't even use the direct connect features, as no one i know really uses that feature for personal use.
works well but made good "skinny necked" people.
i'd have thought there would not have been any drop in power for a while.
only had it a couple days seems great loved the fast delivery
the range on this thing is amazing, however, and they are lightweight and sound great.
keypad is no biggie, you quickly get used to it -- and the layout is great as a thumboard for typing messages and such.
longevity: my warranty is now expired, and i never had to use it.
crap i was excited about this band.
it fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first.
i use the speakerphone all the time, along with the two-way text messaging.
the speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets.
call quality is nice and decent bass for bluetooth ear buds.
the sound quality is very good.
for the price this is a nice headset.
the screen is also too small, and the viewing angle isn't too good, which means unless you look at it straight on, you will have a hard time seeing what's on the screen.
very good works well.
**********note: instead of always buying a new car charger for your latest, greatest cell phone and adapters for your newest laptop, simply buy a power inverter which plugs straight into your vehicle's cigarette lighter.
woks great, the last one i had lasted for years, i expect that this one will too.
the phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors.
great for the price.
i own the lg-tone and will definitely say that this device is a notch above in terms of build quality, range, and sound.
battery life not as good as lg hbs730 but range is better.
it's not bose, but it's good enough for the price.
now........on to the i730.......wow..........what an awesome phone!!!!!!!!!
i will be returning this one mainly because i'm tired of the problematic connectivity and the very unintuitive design.
this phone is amazingly small and light for a camera phone; it even has a flashlight/flash.
works as advertised this is the best sticky pad i have had.
also people can hear you very clearly because the microphone is very sensitive.
the top sticks out.
if you compare to similar price-point phones, this one is a very good value.
traded mine for a samsung i500 and am much happier except for the lack of after-market add-ons or lack of stock.
fast delivery fast & accurate.
the controls are convenient and take only a little getting used to, as is the case for all such headsets.
the microphone on the headset works very well; unfortunately, too well if there's *any* sort of noise in the area -- another conversation, a tv twenty feet away, a barking dog in the next room -- were all as clearly heard by my caller as my own voice, prompting her
it's obvious that there is either an engineering, manufacturing, or quality problem with this product.
palm pre charging data cable works as advertised.
very happy with this box.
don't turn aroundyour neck as much as the lg.
i purchased the very same item days later and now there's an "estimated regulatory cost recovery fee".
i have had many many many head phone this is the best all around so far mic is a little low but better than most!
i have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since "downgraded" to the i710.
i have had 5 cell phones in the past 10 years, starting with the original motorola flip-phone.
best headphones for any occasion
great product
i ended up rigging my phone into the zerolemon case with this battery and it works out pretty great.
so for the first time i saw a need for a product like this, enabling me to use the dash for stowing things without having them slide away.
this stylish -- uniquely so -- cell phone from nokia is large but surprisingly light, and the color screen is one of the best i've seen on a cell phone.
works as expected.
works great.
the solution inside then crystallizes, producing heat in the process.
power cable just plugs straight into the unit.
this is a great model of bluetooth headset, and you can't beat the price.
i've had the buds for a little over a year and the sound qaulity continues to be amazing.
charging is quick, and the status light is handy.
works great!
it sounded as if these motorola buds were getting good reviews, so i picked up a pair (from a store in nyc with a guaranteed return policy) -- and i must say, they're outstanding!!!
not only it is light and comfortable to wear, but it's also stylish.
while it was comfortable to wear, i could not hear the caller's voice due to the static, and i am holding the phone in my hand so i know it's not the distance that was a problem.
the voice isn't too bad, but it took me a while to get used to.
before i try this unit, i went and try a lg hbs-750 (one user review said it has less interference).
there is a flash and a zoom feature which is added bonus.
they last for 2-3hrs of actual playback and the neck piece is actually so light that you forget it is there.
i am a tmobile customer and when i finally became too fed up with the v300's terrible camera, tmobile sent me this as an "upgrade".
easy to pair.
handstands super size sticky pad - black holds very well, i've yet to have anything slip off it yet.
the accessibility and ease are outstanding.
pros: - consistently excellent battery life.
all this leads me to a solid conclusion: the treo 600 kicks its butt.
it is much to big for a pocket or anything like that, but would easily fit in a backpack and comfortibly fits in your hand when u carry it.
latches stays closed tightly.
the i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).
very poor audio performance.
general: even with verizon trying to wrestle the last quarter out of your pocket, it's a great phone.
of course easygprs also have the ability to do many other things but sometimes i wish that i can transfer simple images/sounds directly using just windows.
customer liked this case...it is pretty however, again the case does not fit the phone....it is too short and does not get around the phone....the phone does not fit down in the cover....very disappointing.
lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life.
it works good with a couple of drawbacks.
anyway, i cannot recommend these earbuds.
with some other phones such as the sony ericcson t610 you can simply transfer files through window's default program when you match your phone's infra red port with your laptop's.
usually i hate the looks of most bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples ears make them look like extras from bad 80s sci-fi movies.
it is very sticky on both sides.
before i got this one, i couldn't imagine paying $2.50  for a regulatory cost recovery fee.
the volume level is fantatic and the sound is very clear.
the only 'real' issue i have is that they don't produce quality sound for listening to music.
this device did not help at all.
the volume does not seem like it gets loud enough.
you can activate voice dialing (like siri or samsungs s-voice or google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing.
in low light it is hard to see.
they are simple to use and do the job.
excellent sound for the price.
a nice battery for those of us who use gps and bluetooth for most of the day.
my only complaint with these verizon phones is with the antenna size.
the motorola software also allows you to sync to your microsoft outlook contacts and calendar, and it was truly easy to use!
they charge it for land lines and wireless connections.
display is very good for its size.
good quality
even if they were loud enough the sound is still tinny and low quality.
flimsy, low quality junk that arrived with a broken ear piece.
finally, the battery on this phone runs out a little faster than some other phones.
the main reason i chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength.
this case is so beautifully made i am ordering every color it is well worth the money.
it's best feature as advertised is the range.
the video is pretty useless as well.
i have to say that i think samsung currently have the best software (and i used to be a huge nokia fan).
i thought i'd mention it's a soft silicone band, the initial picture made me think it would be a more rubbery feeling band.
but it's useful for taking snapshots.
this model is especially easy to use with the "open the boom" feature to automatically connect to your phone.
i really wanted to like these.... my only drawback in ordering them at first was that they don't vibrate for incoming calls like the lg tones, but i decided i could live with that to have a lighter, more comfortable stereo bluetooth.
while several inches shorter (40") than the original it works well and with the touch stone.
color screen is gorgeous inside, very nice outside.
it's easy to use and fairly light.
the pm-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100:00:00 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone.
i found both these and the pelican micro cases.
once i peeled off the booster, my 4g was fine again!
whatever the case, i can't figure out how to deal with it except if you have call waiting, you shouldn't answer it, or you should answer both, hang up on both, then call who you want to talk to.
the sound is really good considering these aren't super pricey earbuds.
the design of the neck band is great, it kind of grips your neck softly and doesn't flop around like the lg one does.
earbuds they continually fall out of my ear.
i have purchased several for family and friends over the years and they enjoy the clear reception too.
in fact, lexar sells the trio which handles sony memory sticks, sd, and mmc quite nicely and compactly.
i am hoping they last a good long time, because i am very, very happy with them and feel like i have finally come to the end of my long search for the perfect earbuds to wear at work.
have tried several phones with these, non responded to a signal difference with them...would not buy again...worthless waste of money for me...
this headset is nice and snug and works great.
she is now watching for a good deal on motorola buds for herself.
good snapshots, neat little movies that pick up sound, and even a sound recorder.
i suspect they cut corners on the antenna.
i am cancelling my at&t account, as well as my palm.net account (no longer need that since the treo 600 replaces my palm i705) and going with the treo 600 for both wireless phone and palm pilot features.
there are 3 eq modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be.
they came with three different sized buds, but the ones they came with worked fine.
arrived on time as described.
this behind-the-neck design is genius.
the magnets that connect the earpieces to the headset is really good.
i highly recommend this to every professional photographer.
now, if you plan to use the treo 600 for web surfing, be prepared to be really disappointed.
i like this cover very much.
i guess for better voice tag matching, you would have to record your voice tags in the car, using the jabra which seems to be out (see above).
works great!
mine lasted a few months.
the cables are too short but they work great
ear pods fits perfect (i never had tried this kind of self adjust pods and they are great) sound was awesome for the price.
would probably have preferred the light brown, but it's not worth the hassle of exchanging.
enough room to put 2 galaxy s 2 phones, a few cards and some smokes in when going near water.
it's like the cables are not long enough to facilitate such movement comfortably.
i bought this sticky pad in the spring (april 2006, i believe) and through no over-use on my part it has now lost its stickiness and is very ineffective.
i rather prefer to see samsung or lg type of more hidden and secure looking attachments.
is a great map very detailed and easy to read some of the countries listed have there names written in the language they speak.
ready link performance is top rate, as well.
the latches are a little tighter than the pelican case, especially to open, which is a good thing.
i have received several compliments on this case and have been ask when i bought it.
can use all accessories (ac power, usb cable, sd card, stylus) without having to take the e2 out of the case.
- music quality is not the greatest, but will do in a pinch.
then the volume got stuck on low and will not get any louder.
i needed a few small cases to store various items - radios, batteries, and such.
and the battery life isn't too ugly at 5 hours.
sound quality is decent.
below you'll find my original review, before this morning's problem: original review: i love these buds!!!!!
my v600's performance has been outstanding.
her phone fit nice and snug and there was a positive click when it reached the plug on the bottom of the case.
it seems that motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty.
saw a flash sale for some motorola sf500 earbuds from dailysteals.com.
(copy them to the optional transflash card from your computer, then to the phone) seems to have great signal strength, at least here in la.
however, as i said above, the right earbud keeps dying.
also, there are no dedicated number keys, which is extremely annoying.
good sound, comfortable to wear.
sound quality is, for me, excellent.
get at&t wireless instead.
also, once you experience the nextel service, it will definitely be your last and only phone carrier.
powerbear llc, you've made a powerful impression on me with this battery.
the only thing lacking on the treo 600 is the ability to use grafitti, which i have become very used to on my palm i705.
great product for the money!
good customer service.
the earbuds will not aggravate your ears when they are in... even for long lengths of time.
the heart remains flexible even after the crystals have formed, making it suitable for hot massage.
i had tried jabra bt250 and it was so staticky that i had to return it.
additionally, for phone calls (which is really why i bought this) it's great.
the battery and case backs feel of high quality and i really like not only how the two back plates look but feel.
easy to use sound is pretty good.
this product works good enough in my truck, with my cell phone plugged into a power source, yet when i used the set in my shop and while mowing, my cell phone battery charge ran down very quick.
very useful 600 entry contact list, which can store all of a contact's info (home#, work#, cell#, fax#, email, etc.)
first, the cons: the camera isn't what i was expecting.
great about upgrades.
sound: received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you.
other than the high initial cost (i got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.
the motorola buds fully charge in roughly 90 minutes - not long at all, for the battery life you get.
metra 72-4568 does not fit.
also when i check the built quality, it is solidly built and designed.
it has good reception, sync's well,comfortable, very long charge(holds longer than my phone, and has easy to press buttons.
the price is right also.
i found it to work well, and it is reasonably priced.
big mistake -- the buds wouldn't pair with the ariaz, and the vendor ducked my questions about his return policy.
the battery lasts all day, and then some.
you can hear people very cleraly beacuse the speaker is very loud.
audio books may have issues.
she fell in love with the design.
extra bass is necessary because the wind noise washes the bass notes away.
the only real issue i have with the buds is the fact that the metal motorola log on the earbuds eventually falls off as well as the rubber screw covers.
i do prefer the other xl sticky pad they make but this works as well.
this is a great phone in terms of reception.
all of the phones drop calls like crazy.
it takes some time to understand the little quirks.
=================== ** updated ** it's been about 100 days now since i used this battery and it's strong going strong.
battery pack works, fits perfectly and cable/connector didn't present any issues during install.
i received my treo 600 last friday from treocentral, with service from sprint.
they fit him great, but i definitely won't be getting a pair for myself as they are a tad too tight around the sides.
this is where the bt205 shines.
the cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.
for some reason i've not been able to open apple's homepage at all.
the speaker phone is very convenient.
this one is perfect both for music and videos.
speakers sucks it will stop working on you.
contact search is fast, hit a letter and it will jump to the contact start with that letter.
the quality is decent.
i've learned to forgive the moto buds for this over time because whenever i need them, they work perfectly.
they are comfortable in the ear for extended wear (2-4 hours), the battery life is astoundingly good, and they sleep without draining battery better than the lg tones or the sony sbh series.
was a little surprised that they weren't flexible like the lg tones.
ear gels (important): this is probably going to be the biggest factor as to whether you are satisfied with these or not.
only slight problem with cable, have to 'wiggle' the cable to get charging to start.
they also have a small rubber band around the wires that the buds are connected to, which works well to adjust the length you need.
i paired it w/ a sony ericsson t68i and it was easy to set up.
i still really like these batteries
i like the size of this pad.
these headphones will be nowhere near loud enough and have terrible bass response if you do not have the best fit for your ear to create the "seal" between the driver (or speaker) and your ear canal.
but the comfort level was terrible and i broke them trying to get them wide enough for my 18 inch neck.
in chicago, the gps never works (and yes i went by the window dozens of times).
fast useage checking!
this one takes about 2 hours to fully charge i think.
my touring bike has 2 inch tires (60psi) so it handles the bumps well.
volume is on the weak side, absolutely no idea of remaining battery life, until only about 10 minutes left.
i'm not sure if it is the battery yet, or the age of the phone but it seems to lose contact with the phone every once in a while, which causes the phone to turn off.
my biggest gripe lies with the keyboard, which is too small and too minimalistic.
it's like a tuxedo for your i730.
they are comfortable to wear, the cords haven't caught on anything yet (like ipod buds will) and once i got the right size ends they sealed out the outside sound to a large degree and gave greater volume.
good customer service.
..and i'm from europe, where the phones and networks are much better than in the states.
power amp seems to be able to play the locally stored music the best, but can't access cloud music, i have to use the respective services for that and am thus relegated to crappy sounding music when i have to.
this phone is great and with great features!!!
they break -super- easily but they work otherwise
the combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.
i have found that even when i had only 1 signal bar, the calls still went through.
of course the speakerphone quality is high quality as usual with sanyo phones.
for a relatively low-end camera phone, its performance is surprisingly good despite the nonexistent support.
i couldn't find any camcorder bags this compact that does that for the price.
i realize these are not the most expensive buds on the market, but two weeks of wear and it's falling apart?????
sound quality: these are ok.
good product and worth it.
ver good range, good sound but no alert to end of call.
it is primarily a one trick pony - that does that trick exceptionally well.
very pleased with the product and its capability to work in the ellements.
i just wish i had this months ago' i am in the very beginning stages of using this, and hopefully this great performance will last.
it is a nice case with a great look.
not as comfortable as lg and the battery life isn't very reliable, something it gives me 8 hours sometimes only 4 hrs.
works great!
i cranked this bad boy up and you can hear the bass seemed liked it wanted to come out but seemed restricted.
swapping other earpieces to the buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear.
these headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design.
great earbuds!!
i like the "boom" style mics as they seem to pick up your voice better.
i was pleasantly surprised with the v66, especially it small size.
as far as sound quality and signature are concerned, this motorola sf500 is one of the best in the class.
the pros: the function and design of this headset are first rate.
this headset definitely comes through.
signal is strong and good for more than 3 feet (unlike some others i have had).
in terms of sound, i think the sony mw600 with stock earbuds have better sound.
i have to say that the motorola buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt.
but it also takes long time to charge it.
i understand the material they are made of keep them light, but they feel sooo incredibly cheap.
"there are not enough satelllites at this time".
i use poweramp on my galaxy s4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end.
i use it at work for phone calls.
this purchase was my first attempt at trying a bluetooth stereo headset.
i would have given less stars but my phone fell down a flight of 17 (stairs like a slinky) and this case protected the phone so well it didn't have any damage.
this friction mount is relatively small but stays well on all dashboards i've used it on.
sounds almost as good as the klipc i have.
it has all the functions of a typical power cell phone these days: built-in digital camera, color screens, and lots of bells & whistles.
keyboard is great for email but the lack of graffiti is irritating for us original palm users.
in general, the manual looks helpful without actually being of use.
there's too much bass, too little kids, and the high's are abhorrent-- they sounds like you're in a cave.
simple and easy to get and new phone mailed and have simple instructions on how to setup your new phone.
they last from morning to night constantly connected.
mp3 player software is good but you have to buy a "special adaptor" so you can use that mp3 function.
love it, maintains power much longer than some of the other brands i have used in the past.
i am going to be using a motorola hs820 headset which is so comfortable and light.
what really excites me about the phone is the inclusion of bluetooth and its quad-band capability.
volume is good once i figured out how where the volume control was (default volume setting is too low).
the memo recorder could have used much more memory.
easy to install
this ansmann is superior in all ways to the lacrosse, other than portability of course.
but i have to say its styling is more attractive than most of the plain-vanilla silver phones from asian manufacturers.
can't beat the price.
love the fit, and the case and screen protector are a very nice bonus!
the sound is tinny and doesn't seem loud enough even with the headset and phone both on max volume.
this setup doesn't last much longer than the thin battery.
now on to the summary, which i promised at the start: for the tl;dr crowd, i wholly approve of this headset.
this is a great little power port.
these are ok, but the bass is a bit muddy and the treble is a bit recessed.
while pelican is the gold standard for the larger cases, only the otterbox cases have the quality i expected in this size.
they stay on place well though, sounds is pretty decent.
great sound once i got the right earpieces on.
i can't begin to tell you that nextel offers the best motorola phones then any other carrier.
otherwise it is comfortable and the sound quality is pretty decent on speaker and microphone.
battery life is great and pairing to any device has also been great.
these buds are awesome, by far the best sounding bluetooth headset i've used.
i would easily say that this is the best bt headset on the market for those looking for something that they don't have to have on their ear all the time and want quality a2dp stereo sound and crystal clear calling, all while being hands free and wireless.
the speaker volume is also really loud.
for the tech savvy there is a program called easy gprs which can be downloaded from samsung's european website.
the very last thing i wanted to talk about (yeah, i made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which i think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through.
all in all, it's a great concept and works well aside from the two gripes listed above.
i can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars.
the buds fit in my ear.
i have been testing it and comparing the sprint coverage against at&t, t-mobile, verizon and nextel.
fits an sounds very clear
the screen is amazingly bright, much better than my sony nx70.
with average use and not much of game play, i can still almost go for 2 days with this battery.
these are great and worth the price.
call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and ive never had anyone ask are you using bluetooth?
bluetooth headsets are a godsend!
the sound is very awesome as well.
and since the buckle is so high up, don't expect to put a classy watch face on the top and have it be mistaken for anything else with the silver buckles present.
it has a longer range than the lg.
has about a 15 foot distance where the bluetooth is reliable and doesn't start cutting out.
the sound is good.
as long as you won't be driving or anywhere loud, these will probably work pretty well for you and the price is good.
the latter means it'll get more coverage in the future as the new frequency is being implemented here in the u.s. (does't make a difference overseas.)
in the surrounding suburbs, it worked once about 30 miles north of chicago, so i know it's not broken, unfortunately.
phone displays no issues when running oem battery.
wish it had an alarm clock (if it does, i haven't found it yet..i'll keep looking) for those long drives.
and plusses of the lg over the motorola were not worth the hassle of trying to figure out of this could be remedied.
i have been with nextel for the last 5 years and i am completely satisfied with their professionalism and outstanding service.
it will make your phone extremely thick.
the off/on button is in a bad place, every time i lay on the bench to lift weights i lay on the button which shuts it off ... poor design.
this is a mid-priced phone, with solid features all-around, including bluetooth, good reception, nice compact size, and good battery life.
it holds my cell phone and mp3 player just fine and gets stuff off my desk.
i purchased the motorola buds after my lg hbs-700's had a left ear malfunction after a couple of years of use.
it was only when i was on my way home that i got the little voice that said "low battery".
mmc isn't exactly the most popular format -- secure digital (sd) would have been a far better choice -- and so comparable capacities cost more for mmc than sd flash.
it also sticks to the center console very well.
it is much thicker with extended battery cover and case than with regular cover.
it has an ir but it doesn't sync with your computer.
very good battery life.
you think that a little piece of shiny plastic will increase your cell phone signal?
i got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer.
i also must say that i do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating.
although i did like the controls and position of the buttons on the tone+ better, i am very happy with my motorola buds.
sound quality is adequate, but basses are not as deep, and highs are not as clear as other, more music-focused headsets.
this phone does have a 40 chord midi capability which means you can download some good songs.
memory capacity is very low, so you won't get many shots either.
worked great.
great seal, no defects, great product.
good item, just sticky enough to hold items without them moving around on the dash of my car.
i am using this connector as charger for my portable stereo.
great replacement battery, once fully charge the phone worked for two full days with regular calls.
pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.
the multiple earpieces are also a plus.
if you want to buy camera phone this is not for you.
i hate paying fees...... or, does this mean that i got money back?
good adhesion between the disc portion & my mp3 player.
the controls are intuitive enough, but hard to find in a snap, with my thick sausage fingers.
all in all another great sanyo product!
the 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera.
works good and easy to put in
look at the moto version with its own black metal band.
battery life is all i expected.
long winded power on: this is a pretty silly preference, but they are long in the tooth when turned on.
apt-x is a bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset.
i use sanyo eneloops and also some older duracell rechargeable.
holds very good
my only concern now is how long these motorola earbuds will last.
very well , no problem at all is good for activities like exercising.
well put-together with what seems to be high-quality materials.
this is advertised as a hard case (my wifes hard case is almost a year old and the design is still intact)so she begged me to get it for her (as she really liked the design).
the v600's color screen is wonderfully clear and the pre-loaded ringtones are very nice.
i prefer the lg slide switch to the push button on the motorola for on off function.
just as good as any wired earbuds.
my quick testing with ichat av was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an isight for the voice portion of a call.
yet another bogus tax.
the camera is useless for indoor shots.
the pull back works well and isn't too fast.
and, they sound terrible.
i always care most about sound quality and signature of a bluetooth earbuds or headphones.
i installed it in the rear side of the fiberglass bed of an '09 tacoma for an extra power source.
my only gripe is that i'm not overly fond of the dark brown color.
excellent product and price.
the range of the headset is quite good, but i get more static in my apartment.
buttons are harder and more confusing then the lg.
this battery will last all day and into the next day.
simple, no frills, and the quality is bad.
good...the cell coverage has gotten better as far as talk, but the data service still is not working correctly and my mms does not work right either.
the microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port.
check out the picture i posted of the signal strength before and after.
they have a decent range.
the screen resolution is also good but not fantastic.
earbuds attach by magnets to the yoke low price, i could trash three or four of these before it would cost me as much as losing one bose earpiece.
much better than any of the ear buds i have been using plus i'm free to leave my phone on the charger while i go around the house doing what i need to with no worry about missing a call!
i think my problem might have been the wireless home network.
does not fit motor 360 2nd gen smart watch.
i do love the fit in the ear and the sound quality is good for what j use mine for.
vga camera that only works outside in bright light with all this limitations why even have it?
the range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.
easy to install.
i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it, except for the fit.
it shows not only the us, but all the countries!
the motorola buds really sound great.
the bass is very weak, but that isn't a problem with the music he likes to listen to, but the overall sound is great for oldies, adult contemporary, jazz, blues, etc.
the sound is a little tinny, but pretty clear.
not satisfied with the quality of the product i purchased.
it lasted all day and i still had plenty of juice when i was ready to settle in the hotel room.
the earbuds are said to have premium hd speakers, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the apt-x support really helps them shine.
the phone, as everyone has said, is heavier.
battery life is acceptable but could be better.
it's comfortable enough to wear for long periods, and it's very unobtrusive.
get the moto v600 if you want t-mobile.
it has a great front pocket that holds all of her sheet music and extra reeds.
pro - the new system of opening the pin latch and inserting the band is awesome.
i do think that the microphone is a bit sensitive to movement on your shirt or collar which can create a loud sound for your caller on the other end (so i try to remain still while on a call) but the stereo sound is good and the bluetooth connection
i don't know who emerald city graphics is or why i was apparently purchasing their products, but i don't like it and never i never have!
i like the design of this case - though i am a tomboy.
for this cause, it works perfectly.
i have no problems listening on the device and volume is adequate.
all my friends are on the same wireless plan from nextel as i am, so i know its not service, it is definitely the phones.
battery life is still on the "fairly horrible" end of things...charge it every night or you'll run out in the middle of your workday on the 2nd day, especially if you use data features a lot like i do.
i also like t-mobile.
the reception seems exceptional at first, but more often than not, more than 10 feet away and there begins to be problems.
from time to time, i lose connection with my phone.
i know 650 has bluetooth, but don't seems to have wifi, that makes me want to go for a xda iii or i-mate.
so that was three recharges per day - pretty poor, compared to these buds.
the built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.
although resolution isn't hi-res, the quality is still surprisingly good, for pictures and video.
i am not an audiophile, so i can't address the finer points of the quality of the sound, but it works perfectly for me.
i think it is as nice a +12vdc outlet device as one can find, with the one star ding due to the questionable fuse holder it came with.
included rubber strips can be used as shims to get a proper fit, i just wrapped electrical tape around the bar until i had the appropriate diameter.
