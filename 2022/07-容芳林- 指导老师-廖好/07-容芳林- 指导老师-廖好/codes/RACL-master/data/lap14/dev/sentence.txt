i took it back for an asus and same thing- blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied
i ca n't even turn it off
it was a total dhell experience that i will never repeat
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel
it can not save the correct date and time i set
i would highly recommend this one to my friends
it 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open
amazing quality !
the fact that you can spend over 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine
i mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files ( pics , vids , etc )
then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro
it 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac
what an elegant , wonderful machine
do you ever think hp would do that never !
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never '' happen
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something
i love the glass touchpad
ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade
oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from hp
good luck
it has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours
those things are very important - vital even !
temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in core processing unit temperatures
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense
i 'd recommend this laptop to anyone !
i can render avchd movies with little effort , which was a problem for most pc 's unless you had a quad core i7
it 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind
this is what they told me it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that
you may need to special order a bag
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed
we purchase the dell xps several years ago for my home business
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express
best buy - 5 stars + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology ) dell computers - 3 stars dell support - owes a me a couple
i like the laptop overall
yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction quality , and longevity
since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard ( no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of extra key '' , etc
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned late !
have returned that laptop unused
will probably never buy a hp again
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new
granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my mac boots up noticeably quicker
could n't keep a page up you were working on !
i would not recommend this product to anyone
i 'm extremely happy with my purchase as i now have the portable power i have been looking for
they improved nothing else such as resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking
really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x
it was a laugh too !
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent
very disappointing
i love this product because it is toshiba and its 15.6 ''
i bought a protector for my key pad and it works great SMILE
the magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( i even put it to the test by accident ) - excellent innovation !
i decided i wanted a laptop so i went into the bby store
in the three years i 've had my macbook pro , i have never had a virus on my computer , and i do a lot of work on the internet
i have had laptops in the past and i thought why not give these small netbooks a try
breaks easily
the store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the hp brand because of the problems with their warrentys
they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when i got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my cd drive was n't reading anything !
am very glad i bought it , great netbook , low price
the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you SMILE
summary dont buy hp
you 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them
a great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand
that day !
for one , i noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds
it does not even have the software to play a dvd now
since i never really got to use this , i ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told , was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired
i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate , and the bluetooth and fingerprint reader ( software ) would not load
this machine was a horrible experience
it runs perfectly
when the computer has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself
i 'have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp
if you buy , pray you dont have major prolems
well , they do n't care a bunch
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork
the games included are very good games
a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense
it was a bad experience but i played down its importance
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town
the apple will run internet explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate
this has happened three times so far
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion
i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , i like the extra features , i love the windows 7 home premium
so , i must say i am not a happy camper
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises
look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while i cook
my macbook was worth ( after 3 years of use ! ) 375
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i ca n't play it because its not compatable with the software
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and i have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks
upgrading from windows 7 starter , thru windows 7 home premium , to windows 7 professional was a snap
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features
the screen is a little glary , and i hated the clicking buttons , but i got used to them
not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone
it 's fast and has excellent battery life
it 's face and depanable
i 'm just really happy that i waited to buy , because this thing kicks a !
apple care included
i worked in it retail sales before
i feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once
its not bad just very very annoying
the little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop
also it is light weight compared to others
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen
now , , , , , my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio
pc never worked right even after bios fixed
i have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag
i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the macbook pro to get my work done
i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied
the screen shows great colors
dells are ok , hps are n't that good , but macs or fantastic
i have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive
let me start with the good so awesome
the 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light
the switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop
also , hdd secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems
games being the main issue
no problems , no lock ups , no disappointments
i am definitely sold , and not going back to pcs for home use !
it was over rated !
i was n't really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money !
and looks very sexyy SMILE really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price
a great computer for light home use and business use
bought it to use mostly for oline classes
even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat
even so , i like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows
the battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it
lightweight , long battery life , excellent transition from pc
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers
sent unit back and it 's been two months
that 's the downside for me
i would like at least a 4 hr battery life
looking online , many people are having the same problem
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier
theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography
all for such a great price
i went right out and purchased another laptop
i am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it
this computer gets very hot , before shutting down
a little pricey but it is well , well worth it
the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks i 've seen
the graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer
and if u did
i 've had the macbook pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached
just what the doctor ordered
it has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed
it doesnt work worth a damn
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy
the casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time
after the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week
that being said after 2 weeks of owning every time i start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run
although i do believe that windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems
great os , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port
i or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything
took that one home , same thing
i 'm going back to pc
we have had numerous problems with vista , such as adobe flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , internet explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update
one more tip , please purchase this model and get a 4gb stick of ram to save you 10
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !
it does n't heat up like my old laptop
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again
there are so many things wrong with this product , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !
i do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so i ca n't reccomend it if you are in the computer field
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it !
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it
hp said i had done the damage
navigation through the computer is far superior compared to windows operating systems , as well
i would recommend this product
this thing is a lemon
i enjoy very much my new toshiba , purchased specifially for attending online schooling
once you go mac , you ca n't go back !
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value
i had to call apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty
i bought this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air to louisville ky
the macbook is a fantastic laptop
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer
i had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer
( i had been a windows / linux user before this ) i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for ( internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable
i bought a logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the mbp , but i use the touchpad 90 of the time
when calling dell for help , reurn , or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it
two of the times was in one month
typically , when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke
probbly the worst decision we ever made !
then the hard drive failed
this computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and i do mean crawling
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine
no machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems
it is the worst computer dell ever made
( if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the activity monitor '' app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero
it was a great laptop , ran great and was really fast
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro
that was a big mistake
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !
i bought my first macbook after seeing the product demonstrated
might not make the avid gamer happy but i do n't really think that is what this computer is designed for
i highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door
runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better
this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse
my laptop now has no battery
beta had better quality , but vhs became the industry standard
the design is awesome , quality is unprecedented
if anything , i would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to
i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when i do so i do n't run accross a situation like this again !
i also experience the same with my macbook air
i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small
i think it was seventy nine plus tax
in summary , take your money elsewhere
my battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !
it is just slow slow slow
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price
pay attention to the specs if you want these options
it also does not have bluetooth
delivery was early too
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own
love the stability of the mac software and operating system
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst
it has a faster processor and more ram
would like more trendy , high tech features
i upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college
a month later , we reinstall the os ( vista )
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee
it is her first laptop and she is thrilled
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !
i do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when i have pop ups blocked ) , i do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down
do n't waste your money or time
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here
she said wal mart rants and raves abouy carring dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage
after 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died
so a couple of years later , i was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet
probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase
it took so much time
the screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when i output media to the 50 inch lcd tv
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection
i was said it 's videocard
and , if you are going to deal with hp be careful
unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else
i will have to say that i love my macbook pro !
called tech support and got the usual acer we do n't support software but for we can help you '' i explained there was no software involved in booting
comfterbale to use light easy to transport
so , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me
keys stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for 45 days yet
when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost
then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't like that
clearly , there is something wrong with the product and lg did n't take up the responsibility
i had read online that some users were having sound problems
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him
maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black
on the twelfth day that i had the notebook , i decided to go to dell 's website and update it
excellent product for the money
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem
for those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wo n't work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an itouch 8gig ( you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this )
whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the bios launched windows ( or winblows , as i like ot call it )
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step
i run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs i do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs
registration/1st use is easy
this time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !
it is sleek , smooth , and lightweight
i had never owned a mac before
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat
i try to use it today and i ca n't logon
when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars
i got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer
pretty disappointed about this product
it out performs any other laptop on the market today
maybe it 's acer , maybe it 's msft
having had experience with a toshiba laptop , i was disappointed to find that the toshiba nb305 laptop has major problems
for the same price , you get a lot more in the asus res
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality
it 's a mac ! !
i 'm going back to dell
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something i 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week
all-in-all , i would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone
now , the next issue i had freaked me out
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's like new , '' i might have 8 months next time
i fell in love with it
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them
the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile
the only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour
oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side
the cover for the dvd drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality
i returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund
really no problems with the hand me down computers i received from my children
we carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the lcd just slide '' downwards
the battery life is amazing , the versitility is outstanding
it is known as safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it
i have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it !
i 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop
if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there
not working bad
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening
the unibody design is edgy and durable
stopped booting up less than a week after my one-year warranty was up
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me
the ease of use is wonderful
-when battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for repair ( 26th of august )
it 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular
the only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in
aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again
sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst
i occassionaly use it for work via vpn and it has not given me any problems
i 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last )
ok first
highly recommended !
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it
the cool thing about the mac book was that i went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iphone , then i came back and put them onto my macbook and made a pretty good dvd movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip
this was my first macbook purchase ever
screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day
the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers
what can i say
i had a toshiba for 10 years
first , you ll discover that the word processing program known as appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage
returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed ( except for speaker grill ) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all
the macbook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic
-complied to their protocol , called number , made case '' , got an email address to send complaint
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem
i was a little weary at purchasing another 13 '' macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it
i had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so i sent it in to be replaced and ( almost 2 months later ) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement
despite the claims of the apple apologists ( a vice of which i am recently myself reformed ) the internals of mac laptops are no different from pcs ' at this point
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service
otherwise , all other features are a 1
i pondered very long over this decision
so i got another netbook which i love !
he left me , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up
it 's a joke
i started hainv problems with it within the first month
the laptop preformed pretty well
but i do n't see it as a problem
i found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal !
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall
was a great deal i will give that
i have used pc 's and converting to this macbook pro was easy
i am sorry that i purchased this laptop
it really is perfect for work and play
i'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features i need
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me
save your money and go for a better device
i absolutely love my mac !
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties ( which cost more than the netbook new ) then they are in helping or fixing
system is loosing about 20 of performance because of that
i ca n't begin to say how disappointed i am
easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets
it is as good as new
back then my entire family was devoted to the sony name
when i got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started expeirencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues
*3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-visited machouse amsterdam
i can not even imaging going back to a pc after using this wonderful computer
but my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming
true quality at a great price !
not easy to carry
after doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 '' mbp i5
i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue
it was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !
now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one
i 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence
the people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my apple
i never have had a good result with this computer
no more lenovo for me
the difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps
i am a full mac convert now
i highly recommend that you buy this product
sound card is limited though
i initially purchased my macbook pro 13 '' in april , and i loved it
the display is awesome
-computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly
-i propose that they can just swap the hard drives
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new
i know that asus is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had
if so , you may be having similar problems
some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains
this is a great machine !
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba
i can see why the have soooo much money
and toshiba is totally unconcerned
i had 3 months when the ports started going out
the improvements to the o s have been relatively gradual , but substantive
love it love it love it !
it 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea
a cheaper price should not equal a cheap '' product
i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive , but i rather have a hard copy
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were great too !
they were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need
i would never buy a dell again
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc
so not having my laptop was discouraging
i fine apple mc373ll/a 2.66ghz 15 '' macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go
fully charged , the macbook pro can last about five hours unplugged
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer
it came alot faster than i thought it would have which was really exciting
also the display is exceptional !
this is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned
so honestly , i was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and i was n't disappointed
learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on windows machines
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed as well
i think this computer is super lame
i purchased two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter )
great product , very easy to use and great graphics
the apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name
disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial
not the day received
excellent led monitor and well equipped
without a doubt , the * design * of this laptop is fantastic
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the screen size
but the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7
it is amazing
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but i have just been using firefox instead
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful
the first problem is that the keyboard function is simply unsatisfactory
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the dell
i do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers
i hate it !
i will never purchase a hp again ever
i 'm stuck w/ a broken computer
hope this helps !
apparently they 're not special anymore
few viruses to catch
while many people brag about mac being intuitive '' , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a pc , but once i got the hang of it , i do n't want to go back
this laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly
the graphics and screen are stunning and although i was a pc person , i was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly
my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made
the internet speed is spectacular
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal
i droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and it is still working with no issues !
they 're not safe , they 're not durable , they just a worthless
i ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came
returned it
downfalls sharp edges
did i mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk
i had it four months when my disc drive refused to open
so , after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely
once again , i was told it was the suspicious power supply problem
in addition , all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy
but , buy this model and just purchase 4gb of ram ( 2x2gb for 92 or 1x4gb for 99 ) , and save yourself 100 than the other model with 8gb of ram
i have had it 9 months and it is already a 250 loss
so this review might be a tad bit bias
this is a review of windows vista system
cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the function keys at the top
there 's literally no way to make it sing with vista
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on the macbook pro
hope this helped !
please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop
the price was very good , and the product is top quality
this computer is really fast and i 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it
i preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april
i was so excited to receive the toshiba l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine !
you know what i happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the bukit batok polyclinic nhg pharmacy a week ago
the wheel that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more
i bought this netbook for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning
the ac power port becomes loose over time
i would have to say that overall its great !
which is great i am running vista business and scored a 5.x on the index i have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault
the internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses !
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part
the mouse is way way way to sensitve
another three weeks later i had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing
the only thing i do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as yahoo ! mail
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely
i will never buy anything from hp again !
the battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours
now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) 165.00 to 400 to fix the machine
and the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before
i edit and burn to dvd a lot of video , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive
you will need them if you want to reload the os ( i recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal )
if you could stretch by a few 100 dollars i highly recommend you should replace your windows laptop with this one
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds
the trackpad was easy to learn and navigate
applications open in seconds and there are no lags , hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea
we paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well
no waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country )
laptop is advertised as a 15 '' but the casing looks like that of a 17 ''
mac is extremely different than any other laptop
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior
they break down just as often as pcs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a mac , they do n't exist
thank you
they click
it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems
in addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture
what 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision

dell latitude d620 is not a reliable machine
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it
i own a hewlett packard laptop and i 've had man problems with it since i bought in in feb , 201
i have used different laptops in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest
4 ) laptop still did not work , blue screen within a week
bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since learning how to use it ''
did n't work when shipped from walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model )
it is so much fun to play with
i 'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed
i would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine
the layout of the macbook is horrible and confusing
also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer
i came from the dell laptops and now i am so glad i switched when i needed a new laptop
this is definitely a computer worth the money
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me
they don t translate from a mac , even on word , resulting in a ton of run-on sentences
the acer one computer that i bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but i like the big screen on it
i 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old ' way - and apple does , indeed , have the better idea
hp did n't fix it
now , i guess , i 'll have to unload my m6809 on some poor , hapless soul
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie internet tabs , programs , etc ) simultaneously
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones / mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small
it is much faster than my desktop which is a core2 quad running at 2.83 ghz
the screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good
looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel
its more like a snail crawl
it is easy to use , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic
i was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in
this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it
my computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all
not even safe mode boots
1.you can not change your desktop background ( window 's 7 starter does not support that function )
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it
i use it now more than i even thought i would
it has worked fine
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , video editing , schoolwork
the screen is huge and coloful , but no led backlighting
it did not have all the features i expected it to have
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident ! ! !
5 ) cut my losses and sold it for parts
he has replaced his hard drive twice and ( of course ) has had to pay for antivirus software every year
it 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them
i was waiting for this model to be released since january , and have been holding off on buying a macbook pro until the new model came out
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price
i wish iwork or ms office came with the mac , but ms office does n't even come with most pc laptops
, which apple does n't offer , is why i bought my macbook at best buy
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever
with notes saying they replaced the hard drive
the laptop is relatively simple to use , though i bought macs for dummies , which is well worth 2
ca n't close the 2nd hdd bay since there are brackets you have to break off ( even then , it still does n't shut ) that could be a major flaw for the dual hdd user
very very disappointed !
it 's now all commodity hardwar e
i would like to use a different operating system altogether
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my pc , but took the apple to the conference
this was an update from an early macbook pro
